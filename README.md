"Brain Tumor Detection: This project uses Machine Learning to classify MRI images for tumor presence. It involves training a model on labeled MRI data, allowing it to accurately distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cases. The model then tests new images, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment decisions."
